#Hello Everyone

I am a Mathematics student at Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) with a strong interest in data analysis. I have a high level of enthusiasm for understanding and processing data to generate meaningful insights. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed skills in Python programming, which I use for data analysis and mathematical modeling. I am always eager to learn new things and seek opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects.
